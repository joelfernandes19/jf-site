Me on cloud9 ðŸ˜€ My previous blog post, **[Bangalore Tweetup and Photo Walk](http://www.joelifernandes.com/bangalore-tweetup-and-photo-walk/)** was published in Bangalore Mirror. Hereâ€™s the a shot of it<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Thanks to [Balu](http://twitter.com/chupchap) for publishing it<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

And thatâ€™s not it! I was on Times of India too! Thatâ€™s a huge thing for me ðŸ˜€ We are a group on Flickr called [Bangalore Photo Walk (BPW)](http://www.flickr.com/groups/blorephotowalk/pool/) and we host weekend photo walks in and around Bangalore. I happened to contact Nirmala, a journal at TOI and introduced our BPW group to her. She shared all the details with the Editor and the Editor asked me to form a group of 6 and asked the 6 of us go to different places in Bangalore and capture some interesting shots at the same time. In the sense, we were supposed to go to different places individually and click some shots at one particular (same) time. The time and the place was all our choice. So, we planned on it and decided to go on 23rd July, 2009 (It was my [momâ€™s birthday](http://www.daijiworld.com/chan/egreet_view.asp?eg_id=128466) that day<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). We started our walk at 10:30am in the morning and completed it by 12 noon. Unfortunately, one out of the 6 dropped coz of unavoidable conditions and we were only 5 of us.

Now, the real work started! We had to choose 1 best shot out of all the shots we had captured. Everyone did it and sent it to me. In turn, I forwarded the-best-chosen shots to Nirmala with a brief write-up about usâ€¦And it is today, July 29th, our shots were published on [page 16](http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=16&sectid=edid=&edlabel=TOIBG&mydateHid=29-07-2009&pubname=Times%20of%20India%20-%20Bangalore&edname=&articleid=Ar01601&publabel=TOI) in the Times of India, Bangalore edition ðŸ˜€ \m/
