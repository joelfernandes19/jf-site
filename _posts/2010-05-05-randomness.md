  14th May, the day my semester exams start.
  3 days ago I had decided to start with the 3rd unit in Data Communications and Networks. #RandomlySelected
  ...and today I opened the book and I'm still in the first page.
  I thought I loved Data Communications and Networks. But not anymore.
  I am mind-$*%&#!
  I can't blog what  I want  to. There are people who read my blog whom I don't them to read it.

  * 14th May, the day myÂ semesterÂ exams start.
  * 3 days ago I had decided to start with the 3rd unit in Data Communications and Networks. #RandomlySelected
  * &#8230;and today I opened the book and I&#8217;m still in the first page.
  * I thought I loved Data Communications andÂ Networks. But not anymore.
  * I am mind-$*%&#!
  * I can&#8217;t blog what Â I want Â to. There are people who read my blog whom I don&#8217;t them to read it.
  * &#8230;and I bet you&#8217;re reading this.
  * <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This is my blog and I write what I like.</span>
  * I login to Facebook more than 10 times a day. Frikkin addicted to it!
  * Its been ages since IÂ tweeted.
  * MyÂ favoriteÂ swearword right now is dickhead. #JustSaying
  * Russel Peters \m/ <3
  * I try to correct people and end up hurting them. Hate it.
  * I love shootingÂ macros. <3
  * I want a Wi-Fi enabled phone right away. And a DSLR.
  * For some reasons, Aritel GPRS is working for free. W00t! ðŸ˜€
  * <a href="http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season_9/lee_dewyze/" target="_blank">Lee</a>, you&#8217;re just wow! #AmericanIdol
  * I kinda like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Castle</a>.
  * I helped 3 people start a blog of their own. Of course, on a WordPress platform \m/
  * Its always during exam time, I think of doing something interesting.
  * I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073498/" target="_blank">Meet the Spartans</a> yesterday for the 3rd time.
  * It is 23mins 42 seconds past 11pm.
  * Airtel&#8217;s 256kbps (UL) download speed at the moment is 56kbps. Surprised!
  * Indian Idol is such aÂ pieceÂ of shit.
  * Music has the power to change my mood.
  * After an argument, I think of clever things that I could have said.
  * I don&#8217;t really know what to talk, but I wanna talk to you.
  * On Facebook, I &#8220;like&#8221; the last 3 things that I just mentioned.
  * \*yawn\*
  * I think I have aÂ attendanceÂ shortage this time.
  * Heard that we can download our hall tickets from the internet. If that&#8217;s true, then its time to party!!!
  * &#8230;I hate it when they ask us to pay cash if we have shortage! So cheap.
  * That reminds me that I am supposed to be studying. %$#@
  * Bye!
  * P.S. (Probably only one person would understand what this is ðŸ˜‰ )
