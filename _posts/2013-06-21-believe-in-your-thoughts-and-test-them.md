We often face many problems in life and are on the hunt to find a way out of it. Although it would take a while for one to figure out a solution, but when you do find one it could be of great value to other people who face similar problems.

However, you aren&#8217;t sure of it whether it would work or not unless you test it. That&#8217;s when &#8220;direction&#8221; comes into the picture &#8212; **building** and **testing** your ideas for other people to use it and see if your idea is heading the right direction.

> To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius. &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson

One can build a great product if the solution has been analyzed, but the most important thing to do is test it. When you test your product with a set of people around you, you&#8217;re not only understanding if the product would work or not, but you&#8217;re also having a team of users who are using your idea and providing you feedback.

Your **thoughts** and ideas are the seeds of innovation, and **believing** that it could be of greater value to others, is genius.
