After [Times Of India and Bangalore Mirror](http://www.joelifernandes.com/photography/me-on-bangalore-mirror-and-times-of-india-w00t/), I now made it to [Deccan Chronicles](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloids/paid-have-fun-824) as well ðŸ˜€ Yesterday afternoon Tenzin, a journal atÂ DeccanÂ Chronicles, rang me up asking questions about what digital marketing is and how it works, how I balanced my studies along with my work load and also asked me to mention a few project categories that I&#8217;ve worked on. And today I see it in the paper ðŸ˜€

All thanks to Hrish Thota (@[dhempe](http://twitter.com/dhempe)) for directing Tenzin to me and sharing my number with her.<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

Quote from the paper

> BCA student Joel Fernandes, co-founder of [Darkwater Digital](http://www.darkwaterdigital.com/), a digital marketing company, tells us, â€œI have managed social media for two films, two novels and even a hotel. By creating pages and communities on social media, we create an online network for the brand.

P.S. A perfect news that lifted my mood when I reached home after finishing my [Data Communications exam](http://www.joelifernandes.com/randomness/randomness/) which was not-that-good.
