title: 'Funk Tees &#8211; Buy Cool Funky T-Shirts'

excerpt: FunkTees is yet another e-store for buying funky and cool designer t-shirts. FunkTees is a Haryana based startup and is managed by Ayushveda Informatics India Pvt Ltd. and is in competition with other successful e-stores like Myntra and InkFruit and aims to offer better services with better design and t-shirt quality. The designs are certainly appealing and worth the price they are tagged at. I personally liked the concepts and designs and I feel that in another few months, they would overtake Myntra and InkFruit. Another plus point is that there are no shipping charges (India only) and they also offer affiliate programs where you stand a chance to win a free t-shirt if you meet the requirements.

FunkTees is a Haryana based startup and is managed by Ayushveda Informatics India Pvt Ltd. and is in competition with other successful e-stores like Myntra and InkFruit and aims to offer better services with better design and t-shirt quality. The designs are quite appealing and worth the price they are tagged at.

Just a month after its launch, FunkTees has already received over 10k fans on its Facebook page, which is quite impressive. While I was drafting this post, I compared the number of fans of Myntra, InkFruit and FunkTees on Facebook and surprisingly FunkTees has already overtaken InkFruit! FunkTees are certainly here for some tough competition.

FunkTees overall <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/funktees.com" target="_blank">Alexa traffic rank</a> is 103,829 and traffic rank in India 8,997 which is quite a good number for month-and-a-half old start-up, but needs to improve a lot on its SEO.
