  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
    The challenge was set &#8211; the film was shot in 45 locations in and around Bangalore in seven days for a budget of less than five lakhs, with no script and was completed well within the scheduled time and budget. In order to achieve this, the concept of ‘mainstream mockumentary’ was chosen, which is a fake documentary with commercial elements like action, romance, friendship and comedy included to work more for an Indian audience. Popular Bangalorean personalities including cricketer S. Sreesanth, fashion guru Prasad Bidappa, and swimming ace Shika Tandon among others who played themselves in the film.
