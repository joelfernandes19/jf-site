#### **Is it hard to learn a language? Was it hard for you?**

_Yes. Learning a new language feels difficult to everybody. _The main reason is that you unconsciously _compare_ your acquired knowledge with its equivalent in your native language. You will undervalue yourself because you&#8217;re using _baby words_ to describe things that in your reality have a lot more meaning.

There is no formula to get rid of this natural human reaction, but you can _coat_ this negative impact in the early stages of learning. I can&#8217;t tell you how exactly, but early rewards and progress awareness help a bit.

#### **What are good apps for English learning? Which one is the best?**

For vocabulary and elementary things, there&#8217;s plenty of choices. Unfortunately, you rarely get to a level where you can say that you _learned_ a language. I&#8217;ll explain why:

Imagine you go to a school that is 100% free, where unfortunately_ _the teachers don&#8217;t get paid. The operations staff doesn&#8217;t get any paycheck either. However, someone invested a lot of money in the infrastructure of the school.

As a result of this, you have beautiful classrooms, full of eager students. Your teacher doesn&#8217;t show up. But it&#8217;s alright, you have books and tools to give it your best shot, and you try to do it all on your own. Obviously, you&#8217;re getting a sense of progress because just before, you knew _nothing_ about what you&#8217;re reading.

One you finish school, you&#8217;re out in the wild.

Out there with you, there&#8217;s another person who also finished school. In this school teachers and staff do get paid, and they&#8217;re the ones leading the complex part of the learning. The basics are in books and cards, and the complex concepts are taught by the experts.

This person **_invested_** in their language learning, and as a result, this person has a better understanding on how to deal with real life situations.

_You could argue that there&#8217;s a lot of free content in the internet, and everything exists out there, readily available for everybody._

_Well, the same applies for cows and wheat out there in the wild, and yet not everybody can just go make bread on their own. You need an oven. You can&#8217;t just go mine a cave for metals, hunt for natural gas and then build an oven. Right?_

The takeaway of this is,** you have to ****_invest_**** in your education**. Of course there will always be free tools to learn the basics, but _a secondary language,_ can&#8217;t be acquired without interaction, conversations, progress monitoring, performance tweaking, adaptable content, etc. All these methods require heavy operations at the other side of the screen, and free apps aren&#8217;t equipped to support this.

Internet, books, tv shows and english movies with subtitles definitely helped a lot, but studying involves an extra mile that not everybody can confidently step in. That&#8217;s when we come in.
