Being legal to vote for the very first time in my life, I have done it and I feel proud of myself. I hardly spent 5 minutes and casted my vote for my country. It was my right to vote and this vote might just be a minor one but itâ€™s vital!<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Have you voted? If not, then go ahead and vote for a better Governance in our country. Every single persons vote **COUNTS**!
