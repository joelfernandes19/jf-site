    On one hand, days are being so hectic, frustrating and bugging andÂ on the other hand they are just exciting, enthusiastic, joyous andÂ amazing!

    Hectic, Frustrating and Bugging coz of my college, where Iâ€™m supposed to submit records, assignments andÂ  all those shit you knowÂ andÂ upon that it is my previous webhost!Â I had no luck at all to get any sort of back-up ofÂ the contents of myÂ blogs which included <a href="http://www.technobitez.com/">TechnoBitez</a> as wellÂ <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That was the most heart-breaking moment I ever had <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I had to set up everything again from the beginning which was patheticâ€¦Well, from now on I need to be very careful about my back-ups and I think I donâ€™t have to worry about any server crashes coz I am now shifted to <a href="http://www.surpasshosting.com/">Surpass Hosting</a> FOREVER! ğŸ˜€

    Now you must be wondering, with all these things happeningÂ why theÂ hellÂ did I mention that my days are Exciting, Enthusiastic, Joyous and Amazing?! HeheheÂ donâ€™tÂ worry, I havenâ€™t gone mad coz of the shit happening around ğŸ˜€ The reason is something else and Iâ€™m very damn excited about this. Hmm Iâ€™m actually not supposed to disclose this thing yet but one possible clue I could give youÂ is that itâ€™s a business firm which is all set to explode to the world ğŸ˜‰ And itâ€™s doing great till date and no wonder that makes meÂ feel soÂ excited about it ğŸ˜€ All I can say is that the word will sooner or later be out.Â So keep sticking aroundâ€¦ ğŸ˜‰
