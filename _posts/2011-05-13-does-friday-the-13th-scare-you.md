Friday the 13th is considered to be a day of bad luck. The day, which occurs once in three times every year, is a day that brings bad luck, and people like me on the Web are eager to know why people think that this day brings bad luck and how it got such a creepy reputation.

The two big <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reasons</span> instances of why it is unlucky is coz from the Bible, it is said that Adam and Eve took the forbidden fruit on a Friday and the crucifixion of Jesus also took place on Friday.

Other instance are:

  * The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah's_Ark" target="_blank">great flood</a> during the time of Noah occurred on a Friday.
  * Friday has been considered an unlucky day at least since The Canterbury Tales were written in the 14th century.
  * Friday was Hangmanâ€™s Day in Britain

So, is this why you call Friday a day of bad luck? Meh!

The number 13. A lot of buildings don&#8217;t have a 13<sup>th</sup> floor. Some airplanes don&#8217;t have 13<sup>th</sup> row. Like Friday, misfortune ties with the number 13. The story of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper" target="_blank">Last Supper</a> is that there were 13 people at the Last Supper, and Judas was the 13th person to arrive. There is a superstition, possibly derived from the Last Supper or a Norse myth, that having 13 people seated at a table will result in the death of one of them.

Other reasons why people think that Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> brings bad luck:

  * There are 13 months in the pagan lunar calendar
  * Black Friday has been associated with stock market crashes and other disasters since the 1800s.
  * Apollo 13 was launched at 13:13 CST, and its oxygen tank ruptured on April 13, 1970.

According to Wikipedia, The fear of Friday the 13th is called as **friggatriskaidekaphobia** (**Frigga** being the name of the Norse goddess for whom &#8220;Friday&#8221; is named and **triskaideka** meaning fear of the number thirteen).

God bless you people!

P.S. Friday the 13th doesn&#8217;t scare me!tfrida
