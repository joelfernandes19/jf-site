  Yes, I am alive. It’s been a long time since I blogged last. I know. Forget that, it’s been ages since I logged in to my dashboard. No wonder, there are hundreds of comments awaiting for my approval 😛 #lazy
</p>

<p align="justify">
  (Checking my last blog post) 23rd April, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a month!??</span> 2 months!? (Thanks @9_6 for pointing out that mistake <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) God! That’s really a long time. But, what’s keeping me away from blogging? Work, Twitter and again work!
</p>

  Earlier, I had mentioned something about <a href="http://www.joelifernandes.com/lifes-hectic-but-its-more-excting/">business firm</a> and all. Well, this is one of the main reason that’s keeping me away. Hell loads of things to do and a BIG deal right on it’s way 😀 Hope it’s a DEAL! 😀

  Secondly, I am very active on <a href="http://twitter.com/joelfernandes">Twitter</a> now a days <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Had stopped twitting a while but now I am addicted again 😀 It’s fun. You can follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/joelfernandes">here</a> and if you (still) don’t have a #Twitter account the better <a href="http://twitter.com/">go get one</a>. I’m sure you’ll love it <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> @Twitter, a micro-blogging service, has kind of replaced (macro) blogging for me but I’ll never leave blogging. Will keep updating this space too <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> #awesomeness

  And work again? Didn&#8217;t you just say that you have some “business work” and stuff? LOL, this is different. Dad’s constructing a new house and since dad is out of station for some days, I’ve gotta look at the place. Have to keep a track of the number of people coming to work, what work they do and what not. *sigh* Doing this all alone is a real pain in the ass. #Shucks! <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

  College will be re-opening on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">15th of July</span> July 8th :-/ God knows why they moved it up. Idiots! #fail And holidays are been so bugging <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> You know why…But business work is keeping me a lil excited every time I recall about the DEAL! 😀 Will keep you updated about this when the right time comes. So, keep sticking around 😉
