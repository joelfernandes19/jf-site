  Heard the song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3dG6cpvvV0">Rockstar</a> by Nickelback? Oh! Yes you might have. If not, listen to it. Else, never mind.

Anyways, heres a list of things that I wanna do before I turn 22. Then, I call it **achievement**. 😀

  1. Write GRE, go abroad for higher studies, work there for a year and come back to India.
  2. Want to experience life, staying alone. (_You learn a lot of things when you stay alone_)
  3. Create a music library (room) containing all my favorite collections equipped with some cool gadgets.
  4. Go Trekking, Scuba dive, Skydive and Bungee jump.
  5. Have another official meeting with a client. I was very nervous for the first time.
  6. Bring greater progress to Darkwater (_Wondering what this is? No worries. You’ll know it soon_ 😉 ).
  7. Get aggregate of 75% above in my BCA course.
  8. Rain dance! 😀 (_Though I don’t really know to dance, but I badly want to do_ 😉 )
  9. Visit Coorg, Ooty, Mangalore, Goa and [Munnar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joelfernandes/sets/72157621373987850/) **WITH** friends.
 10. [PaitnBall](http://www.joelifernandes.com/twitter/bangalore-tweetup-and-photo-walk/) again!
 11. Exchange the old Kinetic for a new Deo. (I simply adore Deo)
 12. Improve my English vocabulary. (_I want to learn new and different words_)
 13. Form a music band in college.
 14. Buy a laptop and a DSLR!
 15. Add even more crazier stuffs to this list.
 16. Plan and have a fresh new list after I’m 22 years young 😉

On a side note, its my great pleasure to introduce to you a  new holiday destination- “**[Ammadi Holiday Home](http://www.ammadi.com/)**” located in Koppa, Chickmagalur district. Its owned by my friend, Chaitra and her husband Ashwin.

Ammadi is an ideal place for a memorable holiday. It has one of the biggest Chouki (Thotti mane) in the near by locality. A holiday at Ammadi home stay will definitely be a memorable one, which you will cherish for a very long time. Must plan for a trip there once<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
