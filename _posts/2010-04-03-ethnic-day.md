  Ethnic Day is aÂ celebration denoting the ways of sharing cultural characteristics andÂ traditionality. At Oxford, we celebrated the day with so much fun and enthusiasm. When I reached college, I thought I landed up inÂ Kerala. Damn! I could see a huge group of Keralites in their traditional dress. I just smiled and ran inside. Girls were looking pretty in their <em>sarees</em> and guys were looking smart in their<em> kurthas</em>. Everyone were busy admiring each other and clicking photos. Our lecturers grew mad as were roving around. Like we cared.

  Our lab was supposed to start at 9:30, but we took our own sweet time and entered the lab at 10:15 ğŸ˜› As we entered, it was like hell in there. AC&#8217;s were turned off Â and we wereÂ literallyÂ sweating. But that didn&#8217;t bother us much as we continued clicking snaps inside the lab itself ğŸ˜‰ ğŸ˜› I couldn&#8217;t take the heat anymore and I just walked out pulling 3 of myÂ  friends to the so called <a href="http://arunpj12.wordpress.com/2010/03/08/oxfords-ever-fragrant-cafeteria/">cafeterÃ­a</a> to have a cup of coffee. ThisÂ temporaryÂ canteen sucks big time!

  After wasting a lot of time and playing around near the canteen, we got back to the lab and started the photo session again ğŸ˜› Few were playing Counter Strike and few were honestly executing the programs. As our lab ended, we decided to go out and celebrate the day coz our collegeÂ managementÂ didn&#8217;t encourage us to celebrate it inside the college. So, we headed to aÂ ChineseÂ restaurant and had our lunch. It was very hot, so I changed my <em>kurtha</em> andÂ wore a t-shirt. Yes, I did carry a t-shirt with me. We then headed to Mc Donalds and it was the best time we had. Thanks to <a href="http://tbrgiggles.wordpress.com/">Shruthi</a> and <a href="http://arunpj12.wordpress.com/">Arun</a> for cracking their stupid jokes and making us laugh our heads off! (If they both start laughing, I bet you can&#8217;tÂ controlÂ your laughter. Crazy people ğŸ˜› )

  It was overall a great day. Thanks to our seniors for making this day happen <img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
