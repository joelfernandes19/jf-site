Good Friday, also called as Black Friday or Holy Friday, is observed by Christians all over the world signifying the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. It is a historical event for the Christian Churches as they observe this day as a remembrance of Christ&#8217;s death with subdued service, solemn hymns, a message focused on the Christ’s death for our sins, thanksgiving prayers and observance of the last supper.

**Why do we call it a &#8216;Good&#8217; Friday?**

The exact origins of the name are unknown. Some say that the name &#8220;Good Friday&#8221; comes from &#8220;God Friday&#8221;. And some say, &#8220;Good&#8221; is an Old English synonym for &#8220;holy&#8221; and hence is applied as an adjective to the day. But Christians believe it is &#8220;Good&#8221;, because it is Christ&#8217;s victory over sin, death, and the devil.
