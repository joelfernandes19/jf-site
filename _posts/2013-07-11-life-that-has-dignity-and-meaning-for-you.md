I was going through a bunch of articles today and bumped into aÂ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130617105130-187399433-class-of-2013-be-the-best-leader-you-can-be" target="_blank">speech</a> given by John Donahoe, the CEO of eBay. He talks about four principles that helped him navigate through his work and life. He concludes his speech with the words of John W. Gardner who describes the meaning of life and how one can &#8216;define&#8217; it.

> Meaning is not something that you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something.
