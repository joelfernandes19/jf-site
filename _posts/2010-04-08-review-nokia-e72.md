excerpt: Weighing 22gms lesser than the Nokia N97 Mini, the Enterprise series, Nokia E72 (128gms) is light, yet loaded with enviable features. 4.4" tall by 2.34" wide by 0.39" thick, it is definitely a comfortable device to hold on. With steel plate and chromed edges, Nokia did improve on the design to make the phone a solid and a gorgeous looking device.

## **Basic Features**

Weighing 22gms lesser than the Nokia N97 Mini, the Enterprise series, Nokia E72 (128gms) is light, yet loaded with enviable features. 4.4&#8243; tall by 2.34&#8243; wide by 0.39&#8243; thick, it is definitely a comfortable device to hold on. With steel plate and chromed edges, Nokia did improve on the design to make the phone a solid and a gorgeous looking device.

A screen size of 2.3&#8243; with 320 x 240 display size (QVGA) and 16M colors, it comes with a front-facing VGA camera and a light sensor at the top right corner. Bright chrome runs around screen and the keyboard and carries over to the rear battery cover giving it an exquisite, neat and graceful look.

The E72 has a full QWERTY keyboard occupying the same space to that of the screen, with special and shortcut keys which include calendar, e-mail and contacts filling in the centre. It also includes the “Navi Keys”, also called as the optical track pads lying between the special and shortcut keys.

Up top, you’ll find the power button and standard 3.5mm stereo jack for headphones. The side keys include the volume up and down keys, along with a voice key for access to applications and contacts. The other side (left-hand side) has a closed microUSB port (which can be used for charging also) and a microSD slot. Lastly, the bottom includes a charging port.

It also includes VGA recording, the quality being similar to that of N97, allows you to record moving objects at a rate of 15 frames/sec with a max dimension of 640×480 pixels while it auto adjusts the video settings to get maximum quality output.

## **Technical Features**

Running on the S60 3rd Edition OS and a 600Mhz processor, navigating through the menus is heedless. Has a 250MB user memory and is expandable up to 16GB, which is a lot of space! It also includes 3G (HSDPA, 10.2 Mbps; HSUPA 2 Mbps), Bluetooth 2.0, Wi-Fi, A-GPS, FM tuner, Speaker, Push-to-talk, Voice-command capability and a v2.0 MicroUSB port.
