Lately, I‚Äôve been crazy and thinking of owning a laptop. Well, that‚Äôs always been a dream and I hope the day is not very far when I‚Äôll have one! I customized a laptop on HP‚Äôs website and I‚Äôm simply in love with it and if you ask me to describe it in a word, I would say ‚ÄúSexy!‚Äù üòÄ

</p>

Well, here‚Äôs the configuration &#8211;

  * Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)
  * Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo Processor P8700 (2.53 GHz, 3 MB L2 Cache, 1066MHz FSB)
  * 4GB DDR2 System Memory (2 Dimm)
  * 500GB 7200RPM SATA Hard Drive
  * 512MB NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT
  * 18.4&#8243; diagonal High Definition HP Ultra BrightView Infinity Display (1920x1080p)
  * Blu-Ray ROM with SuperMulti DVD+/-R/RW Double Layer
  * Webcam + Fingerprint Reader with HP Imprint Finish (Fluid)
  * Intel Next-Gen Wireless-N Mini-card
  * HP Color Matching Keyboard
  * 8 Cell Lithium Ion Battery

This kick-ass configuration costs me 1,200 USD (Only 58,200 INR üòõ ) I call that &#8220;sexy&#8221; coz, I think it is. If you have any suggestions or a better configuration then [shoot me mail](http://www.joelifernandes.com/contact-me/)<img src="http://joelifernandes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

P.S. I don‚Äôt mind anyone gifting or funding me for this coz next month is my birthday. I‚Äôll consider it as a loving gift from you ;-P

Now head to my piggy box and add some funds!
