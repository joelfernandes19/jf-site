excerpt: It was a fun thrilled event at the Nokia AppTasting IndiBlogger Meet. Thanks to Rajiv Makhniâ€™s and Vikas Khannaâ€™s witty humour, and of course a bit of background jokes by @sathyabhat @9_6 @pratheek @praxprasanna, the atmosphere was quite exhilarating with fun-filled activities, and lots of (empty) wine glasses around :P
