excerpt: |
  Quote - "To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did. When God takes something from your grasp, He's not punishing you, but merely opening your hands to receive something better. “The will of God will never take you where the Grace of God will not protect you.” Something good will happen to you; something that you have been waiting to hear."

Whoever said this, has said it beautifully!
